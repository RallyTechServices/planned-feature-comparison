#Planned Feature Comparison (in-progress)
This app is in progress and will be continuously changing to meet the needs of the customer as their data and deployment process evolves.

This app provides a view of planned features for a deployment as of a certain date compared with features associated with the deployment as of the current date.

The inputs are a start date and a deployment type (point release).

The app will list all features "planned" for the deployment as of the start date and all features that are in the deployment as of the current date.

If a feature was in the deployment in between the start date and the current date, but not in the deployment on either the start date or current date, then the feature will not be listed.
